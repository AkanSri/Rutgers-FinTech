# PyChain Ledger 
## Files
[PyChain Ledger code](../Starter_Code/pychain.py)

## Intro 
For this Assignment I built a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Assignment
I made the following updates to the provided Python file for this assignment, which already contains the basic `PyChain` ledger structure:
1. Created a new data class named `Record`. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.
2. Modified the existing `Block` data class to store `Record` data.
3. Added Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit interface.
4. Tested the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records.

## Result
