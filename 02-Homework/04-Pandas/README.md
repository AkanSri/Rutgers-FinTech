# Unit 4 Homework Assignment: A Whale Off the Port(folio)
For this assignment, we were given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. We analyzed and visualized the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determined which portfolio outperformed the others. We also used this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market.

* I also created another file to hold the custom functions I created: [formulas.py](Starter_Code/formulas.py)
